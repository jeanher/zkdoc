Each UI object is represented by a component
(<javadoc type="interface">org.zkoss.zk.ui.Component</javadoc>). In this
section we will discuss how to declare UI, including [XML-based
approach](ZK_Developer's_Reference/UI_Composing/ZUML) and
[pure-Java
approach](ZK_Developer's_Reference/UI_Composing/Richlet).

This section describes more general and overall concepts of UI
composing. For more detailed and specific topics, please refer to the
[UI Patterns](ZK_Developer's_Reference/UI_Patterns) section.
For detailed information on each individual component, please refer to
the [ZK Component Reference](ZK_Component_Reference).
