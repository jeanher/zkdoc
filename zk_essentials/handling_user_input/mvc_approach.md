# MVC Approach
Under this approach, we implement the event handling and presentation
logic in a controller with no code present in the ZUL file. This
approach makes the responsibility of each role (Model, View, and
Controller) more cohesive and allows you to control components directly.
It is very intuitive and very flexible.
