You don't need to know Java to use ZK, since all rich user interfaces
can be implemented in a HTML-like markup language called ZUML. However,
to complete a Web application, you or your teammates need to write some
Java code to glue UI and services together. It requires [some Java
knowledge](#Java_Tutorials).

If you haven't installed the following applications on your computer,
please download and install them first.

- [Java SE Development Kit
  (JDK)](#Install_Java_SE_Development_Kit)

  
JDK is a software development for writing application in Java.

- **Note** : we suggest you install this first even some web server
  already contains one

- [Web Server](ZK_Installation_Guide/Setting_up_Servers)

  
A Web servlet is used to host the Web application you developed

- ZK Framework

  
ZK is an Ajax framework simplifying the development of Web applications
