You can operate ZK components using only a keyboard, e.g. press TAB to
move the focus and navigate. For keyboard support details of each
component, please refer to [ZK Component
Reference/Accessibility](ZK_Component_Reference/Accessibility).

To implement your own key handling, please see [ZK Developer's
Reference/UI Patterns/Keystroke
Handling](ZK_Developer's_Reference/UI_Patterns/Keystroke_Handling)
