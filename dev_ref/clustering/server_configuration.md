The configuration of a Web server really depends on the server itself.
There is no standard approach.

# Load Balancer (Required)

Be sure to configure [sticky
session](http://wiki.metawerx.net/wiki/StickySessions) on your load
balancer because ZK only works correctly on this setting.

Check ZK DesktopImpl.java, you will see there are lots of `synchronized`
used in many methods including:

- generate desktop ID
- addPage(), removePage()
- enableServerPush()
- processing server push update

The keyword `synchronized` only works in a single JVM, so itâ€™s
impossible to keep the same state between 2 different nodes with session
replication if 2 nodes receive requests at roughly the same time.

Each AU request changes a Desktop's status of a session, if 2 AU
requests are processed by 2 different clustering nodes and each one has
its own session, then one session state might override another session.
